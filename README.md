# prodavnica
This is my first independent project. It's a WEB Application: very simple online store for sports shoes. 
The application is mostly written in PHP, with some functionalities in JavaScript and jQuery. 
Front-end technologies used on this project are: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. 
The database was desinged in MySQL (Workbench), and manipulated with SQL.
This application can be used for small online shops. 
Includes products' pages made for customers, and admin-only pages.
Admin pages can be accessed for testing purposes using username: admin, and password: admin.
This project is not completed yet. 
TO-DO list: password md5 encryption, regex for all basic information (including username, password, e-mail, phone).
